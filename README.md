# Credit-card-fraud-detection
This project builds a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The focus is on minimizing false positives while maintaining high accuracy and addressing class imbalance using oversampling (SMOTE).
ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: creditcard.csv

Features include:

Time and Amount (preprocessed with StandardScaler)

Anonymized PCA components (V1 to V28)

Class: 0 for legitimate, 1 for fraud

ðŸ›  Features
Data Preprocessing:

(You can add more: class distribution, feature importance, etc.)

ðŸ§ª Results
ROC AUC Score: ~0.99 (varies slightly depending on train-test split)

High Recall on fraudulent transactions

Low False Positive Rate due to careful resampling and model tuning
